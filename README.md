# Predicting Sentiment from Book Reviews with Machine Learning

This project, developed as part of the Break Through Tech AI Fellowship at Cornell Tech, focuses on framing and solving a real-world classification problem: predicting whether a book review is positive based on its content and keywords.

## 📌 Overview

Before building a model, it's crucial to define the problem correctly. This notebook walks through the full ML pipeline — from identifying the business goal (automated review analysis) to preparing a dataset and designing features that inform classification.

### What’s inside:
- Business problem definition
- ML task framing (binary classification)
- Label creation
- Feature engineering (e.g., keyword presence, review length)
- Dataset preparation for modeling

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Problem-to-ML translation
- Sentiment classification
- Feature engineering with text data
- Responsible ML planning

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 File

- `DefineAndSolveMLProblem.ipynb`: Main notebook documenting the problem framing and feature preparation for classifying book review sentiment.

## 🎯 Goal

To simulate how companies might automate sentiment analysis on user reviews, this project defines a practical ML problem aligned with business needs, building a foundation for downstream model training.
